Thinking: 

1. in order to draw this you can set the canvas color to white

2.from the point 0,0 on the canvas use triangle fan to draw a circle for the "head" of the face

3.try to find a center point for your vertex in quadrant 1 and quadrant 2 again using triangle_fan to make two smaller circles 
(using a different color from the previous drawing)for the eyes 

4.with the face and eyes drawn we just have to use triangle_strip to put two triangles together in order to form a rectangular shape
for the mouth
